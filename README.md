# What is this?

A living, evolving, (hopefully) epic story created and presented collaboratively by anyone that considers themselves a "coder".

If you just want to read the story,[click here](#coder-story).

However, this is a community project so you're encouraged to contribute!

Shameless plug real quick: My name is Gaege, I love to write **and** code (hence this ambitious project). After working as a freelance developer for ten years, I now coach other developers in the world of freelancing at [gaege.xyz](https://www.gaege.xyz). Talk to me on :bird:[Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/gaegeroot), :camera:[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/gaegeroot), and :bust_in_silhouette:[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/gaegeroot)

## Why should I contribute?

Because it's fun and because being part of a community project just feels good. Wanna feel good? Contribute. Wanna not feel good? Still contribute because we need some of that angst to make the story more dynamic.

Also, the project will maintain a list of contributors with links to sites and/or profiles, so you can get that sweet, sweet recognition you deserve!

## How do I contribute?

There are two ways you can contribute. Feel free to do both if you're feeling frisky. Details on each can be found at the appropriate link:

* [How to contribute as a writer](#how-to-contribute-as-a-writer)
* [How to contribute as a coder](#how-to-contribute-as-a-coder)

### How to contribute as a writer
EASY! Just follow these steps:
1. Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the [repo](https://github.com/GaegeRoot/coder-story).
2. In your forked version of the project, click the "README.md" file
3. Click the tiny little pencil icon at the top right of the file displayed
4. Add a new paragraph to continue the existing story
5. Click the "New pull request" button on your forked version of the project
6. Add a title and description of what you added
7. Click "Submit pull request" at the bottom!

### How to contribute as a coder
EASY! Just follow these steps:
1. Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the [repo](https://github.com/GaegeRoot/coder-story).
2. In your forked version of the project, edit/add/move any file you deem fit
3. Push the change to your repo
4. Click the "New pull request" button on your forked version of the project
5. Add a title and description of what you added
6. Click "Submit pull request" at the bottom!

## One last thing: THE RULES
If you don't abide, you don't get merged. Simple, yes?
* As a writer, try to keep each submission to a single paragraph of reasonable length
* As a coder, try to keep each submission to roughly 40 lines of code
* Star the repo (next to the "Fork" button"
* Share the repo on one of your social profiles with the hashtag \#coderStory
* Tag a coder (or twenty) to join the fun
* You may move content. Putting the entire story in its own .md file, as a mild example. Just try to maintain the overall goal of the project, which is to create a super-collaborative story and make it as easily accessible and contributable (that's a word, right?) as possible.

ALRIGHT! Now, let's begin....

# Coder Story:

I stood mesmerized for what seemed like hours. Watching the waves crash onto the shimmering, white beach I imagined myself shrinking to the size of a sea monkey and climbing along the ridges of washed up shells as though they were mountains. Each new wave served as a violent storm in my make-believe trek, leaving behind remnants of "snow" that clung to the edges of my mountain range of shells.
