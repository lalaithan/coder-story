# What is this?

A living, evolving, (hopefully) epic story created and presented collaboratively by anyone that considers themselves a "coder".

If you just want to read the story,[click here](#coder-story).

However, this is a community project so you're encouraged to contribute!

## Why should I contribute?

Because it's fun and because being part of a community project just feels good. Wanna feel good? Contribute. Wanna not feel good? Still contribute because we need some of that angst to make the story more dynamic.

## How do I contribute?

1. Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the [repo](https://github.com/GaegeRoot/coder-story)
